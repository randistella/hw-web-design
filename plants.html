            <p> Who can resist the romance of roses? Poets have waxed  poetically over them throughout the years. Many persons consider the beauty and  fragrance of roses to be unmatched in nature. The varieties are endless,  ranging from floribunda to hybrid teas to shrub roses to climbing roses. Each  variety has its own personality and preference in the garden setting. The Candy Cane Floribunda is a beautiful  rose with cream, pink, and red stripes and swirls. They have a heavy scent that  will remind you of the roses you received on your most special occasions. These  blooms are approximately four inches in diameter. They bloom continuously from  early summer to early fall. The plants grow up to four feet tall and three feet  wide. They are shipped bare root in February.</p>

            <p> For ease of growing, Knock Out&reg; roses are some of our  all-time favorites. Even beginners will not fail with these garden delights.  They are shrub roses and prefer full sun, but can take partial shade. They are  disease resistant and drought tolerant. You do not have to be concerned with  either black spot or dead-heading with roses such as the Knock out&reg;, making  them an extremely low-maintenance plant. They are also repeat bloomers,  blooming into late fall. The shrub can grow quite large, but can be pruned to  any size. Pictured here is Southern Belle. Check out all our  varieties as you will not fail to have great color with these plants. You must see a close-up of these beauties! Select the image to enlarge it.</p>
